## pag.14 ONE YEAR LATER

Happy codebirthday!

It could be yesterday that I decided to pursue this path, instead it's already passed a year. It makes me laugh when you read threads like **"learn JS in 1 hour"**. Like I said, it's passed a full year and I feel like I just scratched the surface. The fact that I'm still here, studying and writing about it, means this is the right path, this is what I have to do, this is what I want to be.

### What I have learned

- JS
- HTML
- CSS
- React JS
- Gatsby
- GraphQL
- Bootstrap
- Vim
- Markdown
- SQL

### What I have done

- 23 little projects
- 01 site
- 01 blog
- 01 e-commerce
- 01 landing page for a start-up
- Bought my domain
- Infinite errors
- 365 coffees

### What is the next step

- Node JS
- Typescript
- Vue
- Undestand all the magic between client and server
- **Learn all the above again and again, untill I fully master my skills**

I MUST thank all the people that offers quality content online, using thier time to make great videos and teach us for free. I wouldn't be here without their help.

Stay tuned!
