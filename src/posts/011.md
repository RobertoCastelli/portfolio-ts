## pag.11 FREE CODE CAMP part 1

![fcc](../images/blogfreecodecamp.png)

To give a touch of colour at my CV I was searching for courses that reales certificates to add on my Linkedin page and I stumbled at the freecodecamp.com site!

It's free, popoular and there are short lessons that walk you through the last challenges to obtain the certificate. So I decided to give it a try, even for the sake of a good rehearsal.

There are 6 tematics:
1. Responsive design
2. Javascript algorithms and data structures
3. Front end libraries 
4. Data visualization
5. APIs and microservices
6. Information security and quality assurance

It's very streight foward, well done and you can test and interact with it in real time, just like codecademy. 

I think it's not ment for learning from scratch, but I see it more like a nice overview of all the argouments you need to know and then elaborate.

I aim to accomplish the first 3 tematics, but nothing says I won't do them all just to get the Full-stack certificate!

Stay tuned!
