## pag.11 FREE CODE CAMP part 2 

![fcc](../images/blogfreecodecamp.png)

So far I accomplished the Responsive Web Design certification from FreeCodeCamp. It was pretty neat, direct and it touched the basic argouments you need to know to approach CSS and web design.

I must admit I speed it up a little not giving the right importance to polish the final product, since I was confident with the tests, but in reality I was just eager to get over with it, so I could start the more challenging sections.

Now it's the Javascript Algorythms time: 267 challenges to go!

Stay tuned!
