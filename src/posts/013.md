## pag.13 THE GREAT GATSBY

![gatsby](../images/bloggatsby.jpg)

Since I swapped my main site from JS to React, I was quite happy with the result. There was just one thing bothering me terribly: my blog. 
It was hosted by Blogger, with a premade template that always    made me feel ike a scam.

In the research for apps to build, while in the process of learning and looking for a front-end job, I stumbled in Gatsby. Maybe the name, or simply the funny astronaut just made me want to know more about it, and it was love at first sight. Finally it was the time to take a new step to indipendency and create MY BLOG.

I took the **Andrew Mead** "the great Gatsby" course, and after that I filled the gaps with the course made by **Classsed** (thank you guys). It was a breeze, like taking React clumbsy parts and making them simple, intuitive. Those courses are GREAT i really reccomend them. The addition of **GraphQL** was a joy to use and really, really fun.

After that the transition from deciding to change again my site from React to Gatsby was just natural. It's so enjoyable, fast, loading phases are optimized and the code is clean. Under the belt Gatsby makes your site "blazing fast". 

Stay tuned!
