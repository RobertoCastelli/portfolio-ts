## pag.10 TIME TO REACT

![meetup](../images/blogmeetup.png)

Hi again!
in this journey empowering knowledge and skills in programming languages, I would suggest one really important thing to do:

be active in the ***MEET UP*** world.

I can't recommend this enough. It's a wonderful feeling being part of a community that shares your same interests, eager to learn from other experiences, knowledge and stories. Other than that you never know what opportunities can open up shaking that hand!.

I encourage everyone, even if it is been a long and hard day work, to dedicate a part of your time at this activity. It's important as much as studying.

These are my 2 cents, and here a few useful links:

Stay tuned!
