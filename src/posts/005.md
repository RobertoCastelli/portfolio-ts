## pag.5 LEARNING ON HOLIDAYS - part 2

### SECOND WEEK

The first week flew by so fast and the second even faster. I started apprehending with the Node\
JS course but I had the feeling after a few days that all the notions I was learning were\
beginning to slip by and not being properly assimilated in my head. So I decided to stop and reorder\
my thoughts.

During this period I didn't want to waste any precious time, so I started to create a simple interface; as if I were sketching with no real purpose but keeping my focus on coding.\
The absence of every sort of distraction and habits (I am a hardcore videogamer), drove me to emulate a game I really liked when I was a youngster.

So I started to shape and create an old school RPG. What was a coding doddle became a simple\
yet neat game, where I put many things I learned, trying to make the code as elegant I could like Uncle Bob (Clean Code) teaches in his book.

It was fun, challenging and ideas kept flowing in to improve, resolve problems and even\
make it more interesting to the eye.

The base project took me three days and it really helped me grasp a lot of concepts. In the future I will endeavour to upgrade its modularity and add more features. Maybe it will be a good practice using this project as a platform to improve my skills with other frameworks.

The holiday ended and I have to get back to work, but of all the things I learned and understood, is that I am really passionate of this world, and I want more than ever make coding my job and future.
