## pag.9 TIME TO REACT

![react](../images/blogreact.png)

it's time to dip my fingers in the famous React library... FINALLY!

The first thing I did was buying a few courses; I like to learn from different teachers prospective and styles. You never know who will give out those nice hidden juicy tips. It gives me joy when I find them. 

My research led me to:
- #### REACT - the complete guide - Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller (Udemy)
- #### Complete REACT tutorial - Shaun Pelling (YouTube)
- #### Why use REACT - Bob Ziroll (Online)

I dedicated a day for each course, just to choose which was more suitable to begin with. I can strongly raccomend to start with the Bob Ziroll one, and here are my reasons why:
You don't have to set or install anything
You don't have to bother about version differences while following the lessons 

There are no big intros that can create panic and confusion 
You get your hands dirty in the interactive browser from the first lessons
You can obtain important knoutions in just a full day, that will get You going in REACT

I suggest to follow his way of re-writing the code in every example. The repetition really helps you to memorize the syntax. When you are forced to code from scratch, without any IDE, it makes you realize how many flaws you commit, so this method is essential.

For now it's up to my expectation and I am loving REACT!
You can check my first REACT app here just for fun:
