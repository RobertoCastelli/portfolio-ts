## pag.19 Typescript 1° Approach

At the moment I am working on a project with React called **[ticket@poli](https://ticket-polimi.netlify.app)**. A simple app connected to Firebase and a dynamic **[calendar](https://fullcalendar.io/docs/react)**.

I'm doing it for fun, but molsty to speed up my working processes, so I don't have to waste time typing tedious data entry on numerous spreadsheets: Lazy people love programming :)

While in the process, since it was _"quite"_ simple, I felt the need to add more to it, make it more interesting from the code side (which frankly I prefer). I always "try" to avoid the hype of incoming argouments to learn, when focusing on a subject, but the itch was really bugging me.

There is a drive that pushes me to grasp more and catch up in this sea of new nascent technologies, the need to try out a fresh cutting edge framework or a brand new release with neat improvements. Things move fast in this field, yesterday it was React/Vue, tomorrow will it be Svelte? who knows.

What I know is that it's time to scratch that itch, and the name of that itch my friends is **Typescript**.

In a few word it's a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript and adds optional static typing to the language: **JS on steroids!** (♥‿♥).

So I started learning the basics from these courses.

### First impressions from my humble noob point of view

**PRO**

- Inherits major pros of JavaScript, but also offers additional benefits coming from static typing
- Detects bugs before you even run your program
- Makes your code speak. It easy for others to understand the outcome by just reading the "type" you address

**CONS**

- Being new to it, the code feels "clasutrophobic". I really work hard on my code to make it as clean, short and readable as possible, but with TS it becomes very verbose and sometime redundant
- I really struggle to figure out what or what not to explicit, to avoid the code to huddle and clutter everything

I think I just need to get the hang of it and I'll be back for more feedback about it. I think it's great that JS has another powerful option. TS for what I can see is wonderful for large projects where many programmers share the code.

Will it be the new face of JS? probably.
Will I keep learning it? for sure.

Stay Tuned!
