## pag.4 LEARNING ON HOLIDAYS - part 1

![holidays](../images/blogholiday.png)

I decided to grasp my time off work to dedicate all my efforts studying and chase my goal. I never felt alone in this aim, surrounded and inspired by people through the net, helping and sharing their knowledge freely with their tutorials and guides. A number of these tasks would have been arduous without their resources.

This is the reason why my mentor Jaga Santagostino always encourages this exchange of experiences, therefore I began writing this simple blog; maybe one day it will help someone with my similar intents.

Back to us, I started this path dedicating 8-10 hours on a daily basis. No distractions, no sea and no videogames 😓.

### MY FIRST WEEK
I dedicated these first few days in refining all the little projects, which I accomplished during my JS studies. When I became saturated, I changed to adding more features to my site, polishing the github repositories and updating this blog.

Then I worked hard on a few projects that I had in mind, but time is of the essence. So when I came across a stumbling block, which would have taken up too much time to resolve, I reverted to other more simple projects, or completing my JS and Vue course, thus I could have a clear mind to try again.

After a 2 days struggle, I finally overcame the problems, fired up an online database with the implementation of Vue.\
The feeling was positive and I felt encouraged to carry on.

The lack of precious time dictates the need to narrow down the direction and focus. The first week has already gone and would like more time to practice what I have learned.

In addition, I want to approach Node JS, but as my mentor suggests, I need to aim in one direction to excel. I have to decide where I have to concentrate all my energies to master the subject.

## SECOND WEEK
To understand better my options I will dedicate all the remaining week to NodeJS. I'll update my progress soon.

Stay tuned!
