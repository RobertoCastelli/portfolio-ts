## pag.16 Learning on holidays - part 3

![holiday](../images/bgholiday2.jpg)

In 2019 I devoted my holidays entirely to my studies and during that time I had real fun making a game in vanilla JS called [night-run](https://to-night-run.netlify.app/).

In 2020 I decided to follow the same path, because two weeks free from the everyday work and routine is precious time, especially if I want to reach my goal asap: find a job as a programmer, becoming really good at it.

While still deciding if I wanted to follow the Node JS courses I bought, or continue to enhance React JS, like I did last year I started a little fighting game inspired from a Youtube video I found.

The interesting thing is that I did it first in vanilla JS, then in React JS, so I could compare in first person what are the real differences and advantages of the two, and not just apprehending them on others people blog.

I must say that components make everything very mantainable, readable, easy to understand and eventually improve. I admit I like that you are somehow forced to be organized, clear, clean and for many things React is faster, more direct. At the same time it creates a lot of more files, folders, and keeping trace of functions is not always easy. 

Importing a lot of images can be tedious, and passing props deep can get crazy. This was resolved with useContext hook! I found difficoult working on multiple CSS modules, and I'm still trying to understand the useEffect hook.

Overall it's a great library, that can be enriched with a sea of dependencies. I really had fun using it and I can't wait to learn more new hooks.
