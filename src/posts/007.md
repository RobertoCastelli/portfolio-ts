## pag.7 UPS & DOWNS

![ups](../images/blogups.jpg)

I'm back after a month of total absence from my purpose and I feel I lost more than I should of. Sometimes life just wants to beat you down, whoever you are, wherever you are and whatever you do. It just hits you hard and takes away the ground under your feet, staring impassive at you, to see if you have the guts to get up and take more.

Maybe it's all a big plan to test how much I want this, or just a raw lesson to build up more muscles for what will come, but whatever it is, there are no compromises. 

So... big breath and let's walk again.
For this occasion I decided to realize a simple countdown to 2020. Check it at my ***[GITHUB](https://github.com/RobertoCastelli)*** page.

Stay tuned!
