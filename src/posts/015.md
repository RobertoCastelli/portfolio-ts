## pag.15 VIM

![vim](../images/bgvim.png)

Once I was with my mentor in a nice pub, drinking a cold beer, while he was showing me some tips to code the "game of life". I noticed he never wasted time swapping his hands from keyboard to mouse and the other way around, but still he was able navigate through lines with ease, editing, changing text with unreal speed and precision. After a while he told me it was thanks to the VIM editor, warning me to learn to code before entering the VIM world, because people want to hire good programmers, not good typists.

VIM is a highly configurable text editor built to make creating and changing any kind of text very efficient. It is included as "vi" with most UNIX systems and with Apple OS X.

With all the best intent to grasp new forms of knowledge, having that in the back of my head for months, I finally decided to improve my skills with VIM.

I started by doing the VIM tutorial installed by default in my Linux terminal, with no pressure, only when I wanted to take a break from coding. It's weird at start, but yet fun. I found it natural and intuitive; it's like speaking to the machine, apart moving the curson using HJKL instead of the arrows. That is still a bit confusing and not practical for me.

Liking this new adventure, I found some nice tutorials online to get you going that I did with joy. Once I got a few important commands under my belt, I started to use it as an extension of my IDE: Visual Studio Code. I admit it's often frustrating, because I forget the mode I am in, doing a real mess of the code. But when I can't use VIM (like when I am at work using Word or writing a simple e-mail), I feel sloppy.

In conclusion, I suggest giving it a try, because it has and intelligent usage and it will greatly improve your production if you invest effort in it.

Stay tuned!
