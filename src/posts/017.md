## pag.17 Open Source

I just finished another fun project called **[pixel-art](https://to-pixel-art.netlify.app/)** and while updating the list of projects I have done so far (you can always check them here **--> [post-003](https://robertocastelli.dev/posts/003)**), I was thinking at the next steps to take to enanche my ReactJS skills:

- Another React project?
- Learn a new library?
- Learn Node?
- Refactor some code?
- Exercise VIM?

...but one thing I have always been attracted too, but was scared to even to think about it, was collaborating on **Open Source** GITHUB projects.

So after reading some really intresting and well done threads, I can't thank enough the people that put effort and time to write these guides, I jumped in.

What can I say, I just started and it's is exciting; you feel part of something great, with lovely people that share your passion, willing to create usefull stuff. I'm still making minor editing, to takle on and gain confidence, but it is with no doubt fun!

There are a few Open Source projects, ment for "first timers", so you can dirty your hands without worrying too much of making a mess.

Check it here **--> [first-timers](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions)**

Stay Tuned!
