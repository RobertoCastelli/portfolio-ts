## pag.6 MIND SET

Another full weekend dedicated to my studies. I am trying to finish my new app as I am eager to move on to the next project with more growing knowledge.

There are so many solutions and paths, that I keep doing and undoing what I write, because I want to achieve a more elegant and beautiful code that pleases me even when I look at it.

Sometimes it is really frustrating, when things just don't want to work, but I know that I will overcome these obstacles with perseverance.

Ok, enought chit-chat, I just needed a few moments to relax and clear my mind. By the way I suggest listening to this to concentrate.
