## pag.8 BODY & MIND

![sport](../images/blogsport.jpg)

Hi there! after a few little projects to keep me going and prepare my approach to REACT framework, I decided to fuel my mind by doing some sport. I started on a daily basis running a path with basic training.

It really helps to sharpen my mind and I feel I'm more focused while coding.

Every occasion is good for programming and making my life easier, so I was thinking to build a project to keep track of my exercises and performance.

Once it will be finished, like always, I will add it to my ***[SITE](https://robertocastelli.dev)*** & ***[GITHUB](https://github.com/RobertoCastelli)***.

Stay tuned!  
***Roberto***
