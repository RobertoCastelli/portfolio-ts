        Hi, my name is Roberto and I'm a Project Manager, Web Developer & BIM
        specialist.

        Since I was a youngster I had a passion for programming languages. In
        2019 I decided to bring into fruition my avid interest in this field to
        enhance my career, putting every possible effort to achieve this goal
        and pursue this path.
      </section>
      <section>
        In the meantime, I'm writing a blog named "Diary of an impostor" to keep
        track of my progress, in the hopes of helping other people to share this
        adventure
